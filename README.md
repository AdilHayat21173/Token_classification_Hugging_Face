# Token Classification Model

## Description
This project involves developing a machine learning model for token classification, specifically for Named Entity Recognition (NER). Using a fine-tuned BERT model from the Hugging Face library, this system classifies tokens in text into predefined categories like names, locations, and dates.

The model is trained on a dataset annotated with entity labels to accurately classify each token. This token classification system is useful for information extraction, document processing, and conversational AI applications.

## Pretrained Model
You can easily use the pretrained model available at [AdilHayat173/token_classification](https://huggingface.co/AdilHayat173/token_classification). You will find all the necessary files, including the tokenizer, model, and `app.py`, in this repository.

## Technologies Used

### Dataset
- **Source:** kaggle : conll2003
- **Purpose:** Contains text data with annotated entities for token classification.

### Model
- **Base Model:** BERT (bert-base-uncased)
- **Library:** Hugging Face transformers
- **Task:** Token Classification (Named Entity Recognition)

### Approach

#### Preprocessing:
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Tokenize the text data and align labels with tokens.

#### Fine-Tuning:
- Fine-tune the BERT model on the token classification dataset.

#### Training:
- Train the model to classify each token into predefined entity labels.

#### Inference:
- Use the trained model to predict entity labels for new text inputs.

### Key Technologies
- **Deep Learning (BERT):** For advanced token classification and contextual understanding.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For text preprocessing, tokenization, and entity recognition.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** For model training and prediction tasks.
